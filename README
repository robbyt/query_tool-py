This is a CLI tool that will help you query data from your Puppet Master. It's useful if you would like to find a list of servers that match one or more Facter facts.

This iteration of the query tool is actually the third in a series, and was originally inspired by a tool from joemac on #puppet on FreeNode. This rewrite differs from the last ruby rewrite for 2 main reasons:

* it is written in python (because I'm better at writing python than ruby)
* it is really fast! (but it requires Puppet 2.6.7 and above)

The reason that this rewrite is much faster than my last rewrite is because this version uses the official Puppet Inventory API: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/inventory_service.html

Using the Inventory Service requires that you setup an SSL cert for this script, and configure some other things on your puppetmaster. If this sounds like too much work, or if you don't really need high-performance queries, check out my Ruby query tool instead: https://github.com/robbyt/puppet-querytool.rb
