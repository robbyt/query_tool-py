This is a CLI tool that will help you query data from your Puppet Master. It's useful if you would like to find a list of servers that match one or more Facter facts.

This iteration of the query tool is actually the third in a series, and was originally inspired by a tool from joemac on #puppet on FreeNode. This rewrite differs from my last ruby version of this tool for two important reasons:

* it is written in python (because I'm better at writing python than ruby)
* it is really fast! (but it requires Puppet 2.6.7 and above)

The reason that this rewrite is much faster than my last rewrite is because this version uses the official Puppet Inventory API: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/inventory_service.html

Using the Inventory Service requires that you setup an SSL cert for this script, and configure some other things on your puppetmaster. If this sounds like too much work, or if you don't really need high-performance queries, check out my Ruby query tool instead: https://github.com/robbyt/puppet-querytool.rb


usage: query_tool.py [-h] -f factname factvalue [-p PUPPETMASTER] [-c CERT]
                     [-k KET] [--yaml] [--output_fact OUTPUT_FACT] [--debug]

query_tool

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f factname factvalue, --fact factname factvalue
  -p PUPPETMASTER, --puppetmaster PUPPETMASTER
                        The PuppetMaster REST address to query against
  -c CERT, --cert CERT  The SSL cert to use for authentication
  -k KET, --key KET     The SSL key to use for authentication
  --yaml                Output the results in raw yaml
  --output_fact OUTPUT_FACT
                        What fact do you want to find out from these servers
